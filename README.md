# Project
This project aims to check whether LLMs improve when trained on a KG dataset for object classification. More specific tasks may follow if reasonable progress is achieved.

# Data
The data was taken from the github repository by tsafavi (Link: https://github.com/tsafavi/codex) and slightly modified. An aquisition of new data was not intended as the general idea and first tests would be rather important. The size of each file may lead to
good training and results.

# Model
The widely-known pre-trained model BERT will be used and trained on the datasets created. It is still possible that different model will be added and used in the future, depending on the use case and the overall model performance.
